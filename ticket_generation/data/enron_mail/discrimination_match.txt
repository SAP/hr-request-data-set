./derrick-j/inbox/50.:21:We have received a new Petition wherein a former employee of Enron Corp. (former Vice President of Operations for Enron Communications in Portland, Oregon) alleges damages as a result of sexual discrimination and retaliation along with wrongful termination.  Suit is filed in Harris County, Texas, with an Answer date of June 18, 2001.  Essentially, the Plaintiff claims to have been harassed by Ken Griebling in such a way that he created a "hostile work environment".  She filed a complaint with HR and Ken Rice, to no avail.  She was later advised her position was being eliminated and that her responsibilities were being assigned to Ken Burroughs, who she had hired and trained.  She was in turn assigned to a bandwidth trading floor position with no defined responsibilities wherein she was terminated shortly thereafter under the alleged pretext that her position had been eliminated.
./derrick-j/inbox/50.:23:Our preliminary review of the Plaintiff's Original Petition (absent any independent investigation or knowledge with respect to her allegations and the valued placed on same-pleadings allege an unspecified amount of damages) suggests there might be coverage for this loss under the Directors & Officers policy.  The definition of "WRONGFUL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICE" includes "discrimination" which is defined as both the termination of an employee and the treatment of an employee in disparate manner from other similarly-situated employees in respect to a employee's sex, or in violation of any equivalent protection or rights which may have been conferred on any group or individual protecting them against employment discrimination under federal, state, or local law.

Busch had heard only from the OFCCP side, and had no perspective on Enron's side (although he had reviewed our response to the show cause notice).  In response, Steve did a little water dropping.  He told Mr. Busch that the Regional Office never identified a specific victim of discrimination or unfair treatment, but provided only a statistical approach.  He said that Enron did its own, individualized analysis.  Enron looked at specific individuals to find out why there were pay distinctions in those groups where there may have been a statistical concern.  In most instances, we found legitimate explanations for the disparities; in those where we could not, we took care of the situation.

He said that Enron did its own, individualized analysis.

We may need to go back to FERC or even the courts and,in my opinion we should not do any thing to weaken this stance.  If we get something better than ENTERGY take it but do not support it.  Let everyone know that we expect to be treated like any other player including the affiliates, Control Areas, and anyone else in the market place.  This is not the time to support a position that allows for discrimination.  You may want to discuss this in house.

My recommendation to the group is that we support FERC's proposal as a good and long-awaited first step, but it is just that - a first step.  FERC's proposal would eliminate preferential access to information, but what about preferential access to transmission services?   Discrimination will continue until FERC requires all users to be under the same tariff.

./shapiro-r/deleted_items/179.:61:Chairman Wood explained that while he favors the separation of the bundled retail sales function, the final rule will depend upon the comments the Commission receives.  He encouraged parties to submit cost-benefit analyses regarding the proposed separation of the retail bundled sales function.    In response to Commissioner Massey, Staff provided support for the separation: (i) it would provide consistency among all functions, and (ii) it may not be a major operational change because the wholesale sales function has already been separated from the transmission function.  Commissioner Massey acknowledged the federal-state tension, but concluded that the opportunity for discrimination trumped such concerns.
./shapiro-r/deleted_items/180.:45:Wood said he understood "the political issue here with respect to federal-state relations, but I think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated." Staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems, waivers could be granted. Staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel. "If I am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load, I can go into the control room and get all the information I want," one staffer responded.

The difficulty is that our predictions of load and the actual usage will always be different.

It would be a more powerful approach to line up the end state model we want for the grid into legislation - rather than fight for the ability to order formation of RTOs - then fight in settlement over what the RTO structures should be.  We should get into legislation the elimination of the fundamental drivers of discrimination that goes on today and what the utlities are trying to continue into the RTO paradigm.  We want:
