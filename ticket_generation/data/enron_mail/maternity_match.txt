./kaminski-v/deleted_items/2196.:23:In terms of responsibilities, we envision that the new Analyst would assume many of the analyst-related duties Leann takes care of today.  For example, Leann's workday is concentrated on gathering research material for our weekly publication (Global Markets Monitor), preparing powerpoint presentations and completing the weekly economic calendar.  This list of responsibilities does not give Leann sufficient time to devote to administrative work due to the group's workload and has been a source of stress for her.  There are also some additional medical situations in our group that I am trying to effectively manage, which have been recently brought to your attention.  In addition, Leann will be taking maternity leave soon.
