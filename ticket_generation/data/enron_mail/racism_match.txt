That staggering truth was brought to light by last week's installment of ESPN's Outside the Lines. According to the program, Arkansas was one of 36 Division I schools with a zero percent graduation rate for African-American players during that span (which is an educational disgrace, but that's a topic for another time), but none of the other 35 had an African-American coach who was casting himself as the victim of racism at the same time.

When the editors and publishers of our great magazines and networks want you to worry about something--child safety seats, the impact of air bags, drunken driving, insecticides on apples--they know how to make you worry. They know exactly how to capture your attention.

And the networks can do it on free airwaves, a gift from our government.
