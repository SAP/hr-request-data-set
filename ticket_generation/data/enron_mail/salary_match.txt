./baughman-d/deleted_items/146.:126:It is just possible to deplore civilian casualties and retain moral credibility when an action is clearly focused and its goals are on the way to evident achievement. It is not possible when the strategy appears confused and political leaders talk about a "war" that may last years. And there is a fine line between, for example, the crippling of military and aircraft installations and the devastating of an infrastructure with a half-formed aim of destroying morale. Combine that with the use of anti-personnel weapons such as cluster bombs, which ought to raise some serious questions (they have been described as aerial landmines in terms of their randomly lethal character), and the whole enterprise is tainted.

Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

./blair-l/deleted_items/612.:873:On Nov. 14, Enron's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, briefed analysts on a series of steps the company would take to raise cash, including the current quest for $500 million to $1 billion in loans. Enron, its executives said, will reorganize the company around its business that generated the strongest cash flow -- energy trades, gas pipeline and coal operations. Other assets, worth $8 billion in book value, would be put up for sale "in an orderly fashion."

./blair-l/sent_items/144.:30:Item 3 - After discussions with Lynn, we chose to round up Daily Max Flowing Capacity for gas days 8/1 and 8/3 (both from 1,092,956 to 1,093,000) so this would not raise questions or require footnote explanations.  I have also updated the footnotes and comments provided by Terry/Darrell/Lynn and populated accordingly into PDS and PFS.
./blair-l/sent_items/363.:60:You raise an excellent point.  First, let me clarify that when the change to the point mdq was input on 4/25, it was made retroactive to 4/1.  The TMS revalidation caught the change and made the adjust on 4/25/01 because this is the day the change was made in CMS.   TMS doesn't currently have the functionally in place to retroactively change scheduled quantities because of a retro change made by the upstream system.  The question is why was this change allowed by the upstream system?  Is there any business reason why we are changing contract data retroactively?  Is the current policy working?    We should probably get Rick involved get some of these questions addressed.
./blair-l/sent_items/4.:33:Sullivan, an analyst in the FERC Office of Markets, Tariffs and Rates' (OMTR) Division of Litigation, contends that Transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates (see Daily GPI, Aug. 29 <http://www.intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010829e.html>). In fact, he believes the pre-posting discussions between Transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate, so that shippers might be more "willing to enter into negotiated-rate contracts above the recourse rate, in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when [it became] available." But Miller counters that Sullivan "offers not support for his claim."

./campbell-l/sent_items/114.:20:Steve, what I have on my board is that when cubix did the test for 703 the engine load was 89%.  If Cubix is willing to provide us a report that shows the load on 703 to be greater than 90%, we've satisified the compliance testing for 703.  Id like to have a copy of the revised report to submit to the Air Quality Bureau for their records and the facility should also have copy.  My records show that the ceiling for using unit 702 is 68% load.  Under our agreement with the AQB, we can operate unit 702 ONLY UP TO A 68% LOAD.  Above this, we need to bring in Cubix or have a portable test completed to raise the ceiling of operation.  One other thing, there seem to be some confusion about which units are required to be tested at station 7.  I have a copy of the approval from the AQB about allowing us to test units 702 and 703 instead of 701 and 702.  Ill pass a copy of this letter on to anyone who needs it.

The Houston Chronicle plans to raise daily ad rates about 5%, only slightly below last year's hike, said Gary Randazzo, senior vice president of sales and marketing.

./causholli-m/deleted_items/220.:23:BRUSSELS, Aug. 30, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The European coated woodfree market has seen a welcome boost, with producers launching attempts to raise prices. M-real took the lead in July when it announced having started negotiations with customers to raise coated woodfree indent prices in Germany. The French market was the company's next target.
./causholli-m/deleted_items/220.:24:Stora Enso has also kicked off talks to increase indent prices for coated woodfree paper. South Africa's Sappi said it has already managed to improve its indent levels in Europe. But the companies have remained tight-lipped on the amount of the increases. The success of the planned price hikes will be seen in September or October at the latest. Producers have backed up their efforts to raise prices with massive production curtailments.
./causholli-m/deleted_items/220.:26:French prices dropped by FF 100-200/tonne in July and levels slipped by a further FF 100/tonne in August. June saw no price movements, but some levels eroded by FF 100/tonne in May. One supplier to the French market indicated it will raise prices by around 5% in October. But at least one buyer gave the move the thumbs down, saying, "I will not accept any increases."
./causholli-m/deleted_items/248.:28:The motivation for price rises is particularly strong in Europe, as the improvement of the euro has changed the relatively strong position of the Euro-zone producers. As such, any increase would be dressed up as a "correction". But North American producers are also strongly motivated to raise prices as they are operating at uneconomic levels. The danger feared by many analysts is that suppliers, encouraged by dwindling stocks, will crank up their production again and put paid to any chances of a price recovery.
./causholli-m/deleted_items/256.:34:Copy paper prices have slid by ITL 150/kg since April, and there have been reports of spot prices selling at ITL 200/kg below the market level. But one supplier was hopeful that the bottom has been reached and intends to try and raise prices by ITL 50/kg in September.
./causholli-m/deleted_items/262.:31:Cain believes that the most likely move for Oji is the expansion of its operations in Thailand. The group has a mill in Prachinburi which operates a 30,000 tonne/yr carbonless copy paper PM. The mill site has ample space for future growth and is adjacent to Advance Agro's (AA) plantation land. Cain pointed out that Oji owns a 5.5 percent stake in AA, but said Oji is unlikely to raise its stake in the joint venture which is still carrying out a debt restructuring program. Another factor in the country's favor is that, according to Ito, the production cost is 10 percent lower in Thailand than in Japan.
./causholli-m/deleted_items/312.:29:While M-real has taken aggressive measures to balance production and demand, the company has also been trying to improve coated woodfree prices. Negotiations to raise indent prices for coated woodfree paper in Germany have been followed by similar measures in France. The company is confident that it will be successful in its plans to bring the weaker indent levels closer to stock prices.
./causholli-m/deleted_items/342.:26:The details of the pulp upgrade have not yet been hammered out, but the plans for the PM revamp have taken shape.

In fact, he believes the pre-posting discussions between Transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate, so that shippers might be more "willing to enter into negotiated-rate contracts above the recourse rate, in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when [it became] available."

./dasovich-j/inbox/188.:137:In a competitive system, the growing number of new electricity generators must be able to connect to the power grid. But the interconnection of new generators with the old utilities that own the grid's transmission lines can raise two kinds of problems. On the technical side, newer generators can have different types of systems with different generating capacities, raising concerns of overloads and other problems. On the competitive side, utilities can make it difficult for new generators to connect to the grid. So, many in the industry are calling for uniform technical standards to allow equal access to the grid -- once a generator meets the standards, a utility would have no basis to deny a hookup -- and to ensure that interconnection doesn't risk the safety and reliability of the system.

He also stressed the importance of the MM being aware of the interaction of markets (i.e., California:  gas, electricity, NOx).

Moreover, other issues are equally important, such as environmental issues and the ability of new entrants to both enter the market and raise capital.  Moreover, most markets involve traders (which a market needs).  The MM should not "go to the farmer for costs."  Markets don't act simply on costs and MMs should not be attempting to run their own market simulation.  Spot markets are critical.

Starting January 1st, 2002, the CAISO anticipates raising GMC charges significantly.  They cited the following reasons for this:  1.  An under collection of GMC for year 2001, this must be past on to the following year according to the tariff.  2.  The lack of credit for the CAISO, increasing interest charges, as well as creating an inability to issue bonds for capital projects.  They must raise 100% of any capital expenditures in the current fiscal year, rather then spreading out the cost over a number of years with a bond issuance.  3.  A decrease in overall market volumes.  GMC is allocated on a flat fee, per megawatt basis, so decreasing volumes results in decreasing collections.

Defense counsel selection in light of the possible "advise of counsel" defense and subrogation rights of the carriers.  I know that you are covered up, but I would not expect discussion of these issues to take more than 15 minutes. I will wait to hear form you or Steph. Thanks.

Maybe you should ask Jim to raise the issue with me, or alternatively just let him know that you would like to be aware of the numbers before they go to Corp, which is all Tracy asked for.

We are still at risk for over-filling our storage fields in November and do not wish to buy any volumes that might push us over the 13 Bcf operational storage level.  Therefore, we are targeting the purchase of 2.5 Bcf of gas (which may be adjusted based on the customer's imbalances over the next week) for November.

./germany-c/transport/26.:42:The commission approved Transco's proposal on scheduling equality, which allows shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest opportunity after the acquisition of capacity. To raise its comfort level about the provision, FERC directed Transco to change the tariff to permit a shipper's nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacity release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shipper's ability to specify when the release will become effective. FERC also generally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and hold harmless Transco against all claims. In response to one protester, the commission told the company to remove language that would force customers to indemnify Transco's affiliates as well.

JDRF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 85% of all money raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise $400,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 6 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the walk this year is "Mission: Possible" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 600 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

To raise its comfort level about the provision, FERC directed Transco to change the tariff to permit a shipper's nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacity release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shipper's ability to specify when the release will become effective. FERC also generally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and hold harmless Transco against all claims.

./kaminski-v/c/technote/mail/techmemos/6.:73:Harvey  Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis  of the MOU for the SCE bailout  plan.  The analysis was done by a  utilities analyst, rather than a lawyer, though it appears to raise a number of  good legal points. For example, one of the elements of the MOU is a "non-bypassable" charge  on ratepayers that would require  them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid. This is effectively a tax,  since there is no exchange of value  for money, which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly  benefit a private entity.  This makes  the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds, rather than revenue  bonds. According to the constitution, the state cannot be put into debt to  benefit a private company.  For this and other reasons, even if the  Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout, which remains  unlikely, the bailout probably would not  stand a likely constitutional challenge.

A public company can  raise capital by selling additional shares, but current shareholders don't like  that because the new shares dilute the value of their holdings.

Moreover, other issues are equally important, such as environmental issues and the ability of new entrants to both enter the market and raise capital.  Moreover, most markets involve traders (which a market needs).  The MM should not "go to the farmer for costs."  Markets don't act simply on costs and MMs should not be attempting to run their own market simulation.  Spot markets are critical.

However, I had my backpack with me like usual and nobody seemed to even raise an eyebrow.  Now obviously I pose zero threat to Enron but I feel like somebody who walks in with a guest pass needs only a drivers license, which hasn't been a problem for most terrorists to acquire, of somebody who works here at Enron.

As it stands, the ESC will split or fold on this provision.  If the USTR agrees to water down its negotiating provision, they know that Enron will likely leave the ESC.  If the provision remains, then the USTR effort may actually prove beneficial to Enron in the long run.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss outstanding due diligence items and attempt to get Duke to raise their non-binding $14.1 MM offer.  However, the first thing Stephen did was offer  an apology.  Duke has found a significant bust in their valuation model.  ( As if we had not already had enough bad news today!) Duke had overstated the depreciation deduction which resulted in a tax credit for the project.  The depreciation schedule was apparently left over from a previous evaluation. In addition, Duke  conducts its evaluation on an after tax basis.  The resulting corrected evaluation with a 10.5% discount factor on an after tax basis yields a minimum value of $11.5 MM with no upside included in the evaluation.

./kitchen-l/_americas/regulatory/175.:34:SB 31X passed the Senate today by a simple majority vote, initiating the 90 day wait period on the revenue bonds issuance.  Sources indicate that contrary to media reports, a possible referendum on the SB 31X would be unlikely for Harvey Rosenfield to produce within 90 days due to insufficient funding.  He reportedly would need to raise $250,000 - $500,000 very quickly.  Sources believe that it is more likely that Harvey will attempt to set up an initiative later this year or in 2002.
./kitchen-l/_americas/regulatory/180.:73:Harvey  Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis  of the MOU for the SCE bailout  plan.  The analysis was done by a  utilities analyst, rather than a lawyer, though it appears to raise a number of  good legal points. For example, one of the elements of the MOU is a "non-bypassable" charge  on ratepayers that would require  them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid. This is effectively a tax,  since there is no exchange of value  for money, which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly  benefit a private entity.  This makes  the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds, rather than revenue  bonds. According to the constitution, the state cannot be put into debt to  benefit a private company.  For this and other reasons, even if the  Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout, which remains  unlikely, the bailout probably would not  stand a likely constitutional challenge.
./kitchen-l/_americas/regulatory/196.:38:?	This purchase would need legislative approval, which is not guaranteed.  Previously the plan was for the state to purchase SCE's and PG&E's assets at a premium so that they would not have to finance power purchases - the utilities would be able to buy power for themselves.  Now they would have to purchase SCE's lines, but still finance power purchases because of PG&E.  Additionally, it is possible that Socal swapped the clause allowing then to raise rates in order to recoup past debt in favor for an additional book price.  If this any form of a utility bailout - it would probably no gain legislative approval.

We had expected that the court would rule in favor of the utilities, but push the rate hike question to an appeals court.  Instead, Judge Ronald Lew refused to rule on the case because of technical considerations and postponed a hearing until March 5th.  The utilities now face an imminent end to creditor forbearance without the prospect of short-term rate hikes.  Edison reaches the end of its grace period for a $200 million payment today and a $600 million payment on Thursday.  Absent the political cover of the court to impose rate hikes, the Governor and the state legislature are in an equally tenuous position.

./kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/31.:100:When Enron was riding high, it could easily have sold stock to raise capital that it now desperately wants.

./kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/32.:98:These market pros, who bet on the likelihood a merger will be completed, say big questions about Enron's financial condition raise doubts about the deal and make them shy about risking heavy bets. Wednesday's conference call between Enron officials and investors did little to assuage that, they say.
./kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/32.:164:During the last month, Enron watched as its share price sunk to a small fraction of its earlier levels as shareholder confidence in the trading company evaporated. As credit-rating agencies began to cut Enron's debt ratings threatening the company's investment-grade status, the company scrambled to raise additional cash to shore up its balance sheet and protect confidence in its business.

./kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/42.:892:Faced with the SEC probe and a rash of shareholder lawsuits, Enron also revealed that its profit statements since 1997 aren't worth anything. The company is restating earnings through the first half of this year, mainly to reflect a $1.2-billion (U.S.) drop in shareholder equity after the company terminated complex share transactions with certain limited partnerships. The dealings had enabled Enron to grow dramatically without having to show a huge whack of debt on its balance sheet, which would have affected its ability to raise capital and hampered its rapid transformation from regional gas pipeline utility to global energy-trading powerhouse.

./kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/47.:353:"It's easy to raise the suspicion that the Japanese and American economies have some similarities," U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said in a recent interview. "I don't think it's apt to make a comparison." Among other things, he says: "They're not an open economy. One of the things that has really been beneficial to our economy is this openness and the challenge that we have permitted to come in here, from foreign suppliers from all over the world. . . ."
./kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/47.:419:So much for my fears. The stock market doesn't seem to share them. "Energy stocks start to perform when the economy reaches bottom," says J. C. Waller, a portfolio manager for the ICON Energy Fund. The gains since September suggest that investors see better business six to nine months out. A stronger economy by late 2002 would raise oil demand, raise prices and encourage drilling. That's why drilling and drilling-equipment stocks have been so strong.

We had expected that the court would rule in favor of the utilities, but push the rate hike question to an appeals court.  Instead, Judge Ronald Lew refused to rule on the case because of technical considerations and postponed a hearing until March 5th.  The utilities now face an imminent end to creditor forbearance without the prospect of short-term rate hikes.  Edison reaches the end of its grace period for a $200 million payment today and a $600 million payment on Thursday.  Absent the political cover of the court to impose rate hikes, the Governor and the state legislature are in an equally tenuous position.

When I  joined eos internet ventures I knew I was taking a substantial risk, but  believed there was an opportunity due to the strong management, but  unfortunately we were not able to raise 2nd round funding. United Internet AG is  a German publicly traded company with 3000 employees and revenues of Euro 200  million. The Board decided to change the international strategy during my first  month of employment and offered me the temporary job (but minimum of 9 months)  of Head of Investor Relations for United Internet AG in Germany. I declined as I  was hired as MD in the UK and not Head of IR in Germany. In addition, I am  (still) happily married so I didn't want to travel between the 2 countries  for such a long time.

./lay-k/inbox/1038.:19:You may not actually take time to read this email, but it will make me feel better having sent it.  I started with Enron 2 1/2 years ago in the ENA Volume Management Group.  Even after having 3 managers in the group, my reviews were outstanding, and after 1 1/2 years in the group, I decided to spread my wings.  I wanted to make a difference at Enron and I decided to take a position with Enron Global Markets, a growing and prosperous group at the time.  Once again, I was passed around through various managers, 3 to be exact, however I still received outstanding reviews.  With all of my reviews, always came the promise of being promoted with the next one.  However, with the last mid-year review, my boss knew that the time had come - but he encouraged me to wait until year-end, as my raise and bonus would be much better that way.  I knew that he was looking out for my best interest, as I am sure the other 5 managers had done along the way as well.

./lokay-m/articles/341.:34:Sullivan, an analyst in the FERC Office of Markets, Tariffs and Rates' (OMTR) Division of Litigation, contends that Transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates.  In fact, he believes the pre-posting discussions between Transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate, so that shippers might be more "willing to enter into negotiated-rate contracts above the recourse rate, in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when [it became] available." But Miller counters that Sullivan "offers not support for his claim."

With a 13 percent drop in withholding taxes, the states current revenue deficit is expected to be in the $200 to 250 million range.  Canceling the pay increases would save $24,000 in the current fiscal year and $100,000 next year.  Democrats are trying to save the raises, while the majority Republicans are supporting the proposal and threatening to shutdown the session by Feb. 15th if legislators don't face up to the budget problems and solve them.

./martin-t/inbox/22.:481:One of the first derivatives to gain popularity in the newly deregulated financial markets of the 1980s was the "interest-rate swap," which takes its value from underlying loans. Interest-rate swaps allow a bank that has, for example, a majority of variable rate loans to protect against the risk of falling interest rates -- which would decrease borrowers' payments and thus bank profits -- by "swapping" the loans for fixed rate debts held by another bank. The actual loans never change hands; the contract allows the banks to trade only the interest-rate risks, with the price of the deal being determined by the size of the loans and the probability of interest-rate fluctuations. If it looks like the Federal Reserve will raise rates, the fixed-rate bank will pay a higher premium. But if the Fed signals a cut, the bank with a high level of variable rate loans will pay a larger fee.

Since 1990, Merrill was among the top five underwriters of Enron's stock and bond deals, according to Thomson Financial, earning fees for helping to raise about $3.7 billion in securities issues for the company.

./martin-t/inbox/53.:610:Ernst & Young's role in the PNC accounting is likely to raise yet more questions about the way in which the nation's biggest accounting firms audit the books of public companies.
./martin-t/inbox/53.:730:Mr. Melancon said that limiting the scope of services actually could increase the chances of audit failure. He said consulting work gives auditors intimate knowledge of a company that can help in auditing and helps accounting firms attract better candidates with the promise of work that extends beyond auditing. Mr. Melancon also said an accounting firm that relies solely on the auditing fees might be less likely to raise questions about a company's finances than an accounting firm performing a variety of services. "It's not a question of independence. It's a question of dependence," he said. "If I have only an audit, am I more or less inclined to apply judgment?"

./mccarty-d/sent_items/276.:18:     Eric Thode's comment reported by Dow Jones yesterday that "most of Enron's critical employees are under contract" is not sitting well with my people--particularly Mary Kay, Rob and Steve.  He also made a comment that bonuses were "scheduled to be paid in mid-February" (a statement on a delicate subject that did not need to be made).  I know that some of this stuff can't be avoided, but I don't think we're even being careful about what is, or is not, said in the media.  I want a fair shot to deliver a solid company with good morale and a high self-esteem to Dynegy.  And mistakes like this don't help morale or the group's cohesiveness. Could you raise the concern at you 11:00 meeting if possible?

In response to one protester, the commission told the company to remove language that would force customers to indemnify Transco's affiliates as well.

./platter-p/inbox/355.:24:	I attended the Market Issues Forum at the California ISO yesterday and wanted to inform you of an important upcoming change in Grid Management (GMC) rates.  Starting January 1st, 2002, the CAISO anticipates raising GMC charges significantly.  They cited the following reasons for this:  1.  An under collection of GMC for year 2001, this must be past on to the following year according to the tariff.  2.  The lack of credit for the CAISO, increasing interest charges, as well as creating an inability to issue bonds for capital projects.  They must raise 100% of any capital expenditures in the current fiscal year, rather then spreading out the cost over a number of years with a bond issuance.  3.  A decrease in overall market volumes.  GMC is allocated on a flat fee, per megawatt basis, so decreasing volumes results in decreasing collections.

./presto-k/deleted_items/526.:55:Most of the group agreed with Prof. Cicchetti that the MM should not be the policeman, judge and jury.  He also stressed the importance of the MM being aware of the interaction of markets (i.e., California:  gas, electricity, NOx).  As Craig Roach said, the MM should look at more than market power -- it should also look at market conditions and market rules and be a vehicle for innovation.  Moreover, other issues are equally important, such as environmental issues and the ability of new entrants to both enter the market and raise capital.  Moreover, most markets involve traders (which a market needs).  The MM should not "go to the farmer for costs."  Markets don't act simply on costs and MMs should not be attempting to run their own market simulation.  Spot markets are critical.

It is also suggested that we forgo a  "contract" and substitute a  90 day evergreen no-compete instead. I think the sentiment would be to avoid contracts for folks below the level of manager when possible.  I think the thought process is to put a desirable package in front of the candidate that commits them to the organization utilizing another tool.

./reitmeyer-j/inbox/363.:17:Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.  BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the "BEARing Gifts" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

Farrell told me that Adkins had not advised him of any such deal.  Farrell, who is quick on his feet, asked me to send him any writing signed by his client to this effect.   Once he sees that the confirm is the type which does not require a counter-party signature, Farrell may try to raise a statute of frauds issue, given that the deal confirmed could not have been fully performed within one year.

The generator must make power available at its marginal cost.  I do not think the cost of an option is an allowable expense unless it can be traced back to an actual generator costs. If a marketer calls and option and then has the power it must sell below the cap, so I think in your example the FERC order reduces the value of the option.

As a condition of extending the term past yesterday, Barclays required collateral in the form of a cash deposit or an L/C from an acceptable bank. We have posted cash until L/C lines become available. The cash raised, net of collateral posted, was approx $98 million, with capacity to put more SO2 credits into the facility. The facility allows Enron to raise cash off-balance sheet without leaving us with short positions in our SO2 book.

As it stands, the ESC will split or fold on this provision.  If the USTR agrees to water down its negotiating provision, they know that Enron will likely leave the ESC.  If the provision remains, then the USTR effort may actually prove beneficial to Enron in the long run. Regardless of the outcome, Enron's time and expenditure on this effort will be minimal to non-existant.

./steffes-j/california_issues/western_gas/1.:43:Sullivan, an analyst in the FERC Office of Markets, Tariffs and Rates' (OMTR) Division of Litigation, contends that Transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates (see Daily GPI, Aug. 29 <http://www.intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010829e.html>). In fact, he believes the pre-posting discussions between Transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate, so that shippers might be more "willing to enter into negotiated-rate contracts above the recourse rate, in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when [it became] available." But Miller counters that Sullivan "offers not support for his claim."

./steffes-j/rto/13.:55:Most of the group agreed with Prof. Cicchetti that the MM should not be the policeman, judge and jury.  He also stressed the importance of the MM being aware of the interaction of markets (i.e., California:  gas, electricity, NOx).  As Craig Roach said, the MM should look at more than market power -- it should also look at market conditions and market rules and be a vehicle for innovation.  Moreover, other issues are equally important, such as environmental issues and the ability of new entrants to both enter the market and raise capital.  Moreover, most markets involve traders (which a market needs).  The MM should not "go to the farmer for costs."  Markets don't act simply on costs and MMs should not be attempting to run their own market simulation.  Spot markets are critical.
./steffes-j/rto/18.:22:Comments on FERC's RTO Week are due on November 3 (Saturday) so we would like to submit comments by the end of this week.

These talking points focus on issues that were raised during RTO Week by panelists that we may want to address -- either because the point made was a good point that we want to highlight, or because the point made was wrong and we want to clarify the record.

Julie said it would not pass the laugh test but he would not back down.  I tend to agree with Julie:  if you built an asset on getting market based rates and because of a change in standards you are forced to cost-of-service, I am hard pressed to agree you have a valid stranded cost claim (i.e., you will still get return of and return on your plant).  I think it is better to focus on the going-forward impact of bad tests (e.g., loss of investors, loss of market participants, etc.)
./steffes-j/sent_items/2207.:55:We have intervened in the delivery service tariff case and are handling it primarily inhouse and solo - no other marketers.  Yesterday, we filed a Reply (greatly toned down - sticking to the facts only) to IP's memo contra our Motion to Dismiss.  URM decided not to do testimony so at this point we contemplate not showing up at the hearing and briefing only.  Recall that the issue is that to raise distribution tariffs for only unbundled customers taking service from an alternative supplier is unlawful and also anticompetitive and discriminatory, etc.  Our book impact could be around $2 million, I believe should IP get the full increase.  Moreover, it would stifle future competition.

./stokley-c/chris_stokley/volume_mang_/223.:24:	I attended the Market Issues Forum at the California ISO yesterday and wanted to inform you of an important upcoming change in Grid Management (GMC) rates.  Starting January 1st, 2002, the CAISO anticipates raising GMC charges significantly.  They cited the following reasons for this:  1.  An under collection of GMC for year 2001, this must be past on to the following year according to the tariff.  2.  The lack of credit for the CAISO, increasing interest charges, as well as creating an inability to issue bonds for capital projects.  They must raise 100% of any capital expenditures in the current fiscal year, rather then spreading out the cost over a number of years with a bond issuance.  3.  A decrease in overall market volumes.  GMC is allocated on a flat fee, per megawatt basis, so decreasing volumes results in decreasing collections.

./taylor-m/inbox/364.:19:Michael - the above Q&A document for the EPA discusses the compliance supplement pool questions you raise.  The document is dated - so the dates are no longer accurate given the court delays of the SIP Call implementation.  But basically, it is up to each state to develop a methodology for allocating their compliance supplement pool.  The CSP is meant to give credits to units that make early reductions.  The compliance supplement pool (roughly 200,000 allowances for the NOx SIP Call) is only good for the first two years of a state's launch of its NOx SIP Call.  Those allowances that aren't allocated during these first two years are retired.

./watson-k/e_mail_bin/210.:27:Legislature - Gov. Jane Hull has advised lawmakers to either kill a scheduled 5% pay raise for the 50,000 state employees taking effect on April 1, 2002, or risk laying off 2600 employees.  With a 13 percent drop in withholding taxes, the states current revenue deficit is expected to be in the $200 to 250 million range.  Canceling the pay increases would save $24,000 in the current fiscal year and $100,000 next year.  Democrats are trying to save the raises, while the majority Republicans are supporting the proposal and threatening to shutdown the session by Feb. 15th if legislators don't face up to the budget problems and solve them.

El Paso Energy will pay $560 million in cash and transfer $190 million in assets to El Paso Corp, including a production platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The transaction is expected to close this quarter. El Paso Corp announced plans to sell $2.25 billion in assets after Moody's warned that it must reduce debt or face credit downgrades. Moodys has moved El Paso Energy Partners credit outlook from positive to stable. El Paso Energy Partners plan to pay for the deal by borrowing money and issuing shares will raise its debt by more than 50%, Moodys said.

./watson-k/e_mail_bin/374.:410:    Dynegy has filed with the SEC to sell 8.75 million common shares in Dynegy Energy Partners. The partnership will operate or acquire processing plants, storage tanks and terminals for Dynegys natural gas liquids business. Dynegy Energy Partners expects to use the $165.2 million in projected proceeds to pay $148.3 million owed to Dynegy and use $13.7 million for working capital. Dynegy owns 55% of the partnership. In a move to improve its balance sheet, Dynegy is looking to raise $1.25 billion by cutting costs, selling assets and issuing stock. The partnership will allow Dynegy to raise capital and reduce debt while maintaining control of its pipeline system. Dynegys natural gas liquids business had a profit of $41.5 million last year from $3.9 billion in sales. Since limited partnerships are not required to pay income tax, they retain more of their profit. Dynegy said it expects the partnership to have quarterly dividends of about $0.44 per share, or $1.76 per year. </FON!

But Miller counters that Sullivan "offers not support for his claim."

And given the promises Enron has dolled out over the years, it doesn't mean that much right now, especially considering it's in UBS's best interest for us not to make a killing in the first year in order to buy out the company at a lower price.
