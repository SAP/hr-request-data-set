./cash-m/sent_items/58.:63:If an employer promises comp time to an overtime exempt employee, then the employee may be able to enforce the promise of additional compensation even though the employee was not entitled to overtime pay.  Enron's Overtime Pay and Reimbursement Policy states "Exempt employees are not eligible for overtime pay."   Responding to an exempt employee's claim that he or she is entitled to comp time is often difficult because records are not generally kept of exempt employee's hours of work--(I plan to devote my next communication to tracking an exempt employee's hours worked as this is often an area of confusion).  The provisions of comp time may also adversely affect the "salary" which must be paid for white-collar employees to be overtime exempt.

Had Skilling been canned, the severance package would have been hefty.

With a contract expiring in 2002, Skilling would have been eligible to receive a single severance payment of at least $19.9 million, not including the value of the options received in 2000.

Last year, Mr. Lay was paid $8.3 million in salary and bonus and more than $10 million in stock awards and other compensation.
./dasovich-j/inbox/1653.:107:Mr. Lay, who took charge of the then-Houston Natural Gas Co. in 1984 when it was a regional pipeline company, wasn't the only member of his family to benefit from Enron's heady rise to a global energy giant.

./dasovich-j/inbox/1653.:112:Mark Lay also got a three-year employment contract from Enron as a vice president of Enron Capital & Trade.

./dasovich-j/inbox/1653.:134:As previously reported, Mr. Lay sold $25.7 million of his Enron shares this year, as the stock fell from about $78 to under $44, and his remaining stake is valued at about $28 million.

./dasovich-j/inbox/1653.:175:All told, from 1989 through this year, Mr. Lay collected about $13 million in salary (his exact salary for this year is not known) and $26.8 million in cash bonuses. But those sums were dwarfed by the $266.7 million in profits that he received in selling stock.

I talked to Trish about exactly what you have proposed and she wasn't sure from an equity standpoint between what was given to other employees that she could do that. However, don't worry about it I'll do my best so that you are kept whole in one way or another.

./geaccone-t/inbox/247.:24:I think Rod mentioned that Stan has set a target for Phil of 5.0MM for 2002.  Please advise if this is still valid because Phil personally has not heard that from Stan.  The numbers that we have in Adaytum match the $4.4 MM net contribution.  The remaining $0.6MM are salary offsets on NNG.  42P does not have employees and they use NNG employees.  When they do that, NNg charges the salaries of the employees for the applicable # of hours to 42P.  Therefore,  42P covers expenses that NNG would have to bear otherwise.  Phil feels that the $0.6MM of salaries offsets should be counted toward the 5.0 target since it's a benefit that 42P brings to NNG.  James and I talked about this on the phone.

./kitchen-l/_americas/esvl/210.:39:I need to understand our cost structure in great detail.  We need to figure out a way to allocate costs to the desk level.  If I look at West Power (everyone in Portland) assume that we have 80 people with an average of $200,000 for base salary and benefits giving us total personnel costs of $16 million.  Add on another $4 million for rent, parking, travel and entertainment ... and call it $20 million of direct expenses here.  I figure that we can make $100 million in 2002 with lower VAR and starting up later in the year.  How much of the $280 million remaining costs should I expect to be allocated to the West Power desk.  With an EBIT of $80 million times 20% I can sell.  If we have another $50 million of allocated costs then I can sell this.

Once we get a letter from the new entity stating that these people have employment, the transfer process can begin, but it will take at least a week for L1 and 2-3 weeks for H1B (this is what I am told).  If closing happens very quickly after the actual party is chosen, we are going to be squeezed.  One solution may be to let all these people continue to work for Enron until the visa transfer is complete.  Otherwise, we will have to send them home without salary or benefits in the meantime.

./kitchen-l/_americas/mexico/93.:22:Some 35,000 members of the Mexican Union of Electrical Workers plan to strike the Mexico City Electric Company on Friday, March 16th at 12 Noon. The union is demanding a 29 percent salary increase and the company is offering nothing. The two sides are not even talking. The union is concerned that the government may try to force the electrical workers to stay on their jobs or bring in replacements. The union is also opposed to the privatization of the electric company and its leader has charged that privatization would bring higher electric rates to meet the profit demands of foreign investors. The company principally provides electrical service to Mexico City and the states of Mexico, Morelos, Hidalgo and Puebla. It may be prudent to begin planning for possible power shortages in these regions. (Pinkerton, March 14, 2001)
./kitchen-l/_americas/netco_hr/43.:42:- We have not "agreed" salary and promotions completely. UBS are concerned about percentages of a few. I think we will have resolution this evening.

./kitchen-l/_americas/netco_hr/75.:27:I also need to touch base with you on your salary comment. I need to clarify what you mean by salary freeze. I understood you were ok with us promoting a few people (50 or so) in next 4/6 weeks (so long as we run list passed you first) and in this regard I would expect to adjust their salaries.

./kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/15.:551:Company officials said they hope to announce, perhaps as early as today, a series of changes: a lower price for the takeover; a cash infusion of $500 million; new, extended loan terms by Enron's bankers; and somehow, an agreement that prevents Dynegy from walking away in the face of litigation over Enron's devastated employee-retirement plan. Lawsuits by shareholders are sure to follow, considering Enron's restatement and the pay it lavished on executives, including Lay who received $135 million from salary, bonus and the exercise of stock options in 2000 alone.
./kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/19.:96:About 57 percent of Enron's 21,000 employees participate in the 401(k) plan. The company generally matches employee contributions at 50 cents on the dollar, up to 6 percent of their salary, with Enron stock, which cannot be sold and put into another investment until the employee reaches age 50. But Ms. Denne said workers otherwise ''have a range of options'' in which to invest their money.

./kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/32.:124:Lay received a base salary of $1.3 million from Enron for 2000 plus bonuses totaling $10.6 million.
./kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/33.:102:For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million through the exercise of Enron options, according to disclosure reports compiled by Thomson Financial. Last year, Mr. Lay was paid $8.3 million in salary and bonus and more than $10 million in stock awards and other compensation.
./kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/33.:107:Mr. Lay, who took charge of the then-Houston Natural Gas Co. in 1984 when it was a regional pipeline company, wasn't the only member of his family to benefit from Enron's heady rise to a global energy giant. SEC filings show that in recent years a sister of Mr. Lay, Sharon Lay, and a son, Mark Lay, received millions of dollars in salary, commissions and bonuses related to Ms. Lay's travel agency and a paper-products company connected to the younger Mr. Lay.
./kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/33.:112:Mark Lay also got a three-year employment contract from Enron as a vice president of Enron Capital & Trade. He got a signing bonus of $100,000, a minimum monthly salary of $12,500, a minimum annual bonus of $100,000 for 1997-1999 and an option to purchase 20,000 Enron shares. Mark Lay is no longer with Enron and is now attending a seminary, said Mr. Palmer.
./kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/33.:134:As previously reported, Mr. Lay sold $25.7 million of his Enron shares this year, as the stock fell from about $78 to under $44, and his remaining stake is valued at about $28 million. For 2000, he earned a salary of $1.3 million, a bonus of $7 million, plus $7.5 million in Enron restricted stock and other benefits, including use of a personal plane, according to Enron's proxy statement.
./kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/33.:175:All told, from 1989 through this year, Mr. Lay collected about $13 million in salary (his exact salary for this year is not known) and $26.8 million in cash bonuses. But those sums were dwarfed by the $266.7 million in profits that he received in selling stock.
./kitchen-l/_americas/sec_media/33.:376:For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million through the exercise of Enron options, according to disclosure reports compiled by Thomson Financial.

./lay-k/inbox/1806.:19:There is something you can do in light of the recent events. Since I went out on Workmans' Compensation, Enron's policy has been to cover the balance of my salary over the compensation  payment. This money has been critical in keeping our lives and home together. With three more surgeries and a minimum 7-8 months (best case) before I will be rehabilitated and able to return to work, under whatever circumstance, the continuance of my current agreement is critically important to us.
./lay-k/inbox/1841.:18:I just want to send you a note to say thank you for all you've done for Enron.  I've been with Enron for 15 years (straight out of college).   I may have been impacted financially with what is currently going on but I certainly don't blame you nor anyone for that matter.  It just is.  Thanks to Enron, I have had a very good job for the last 15 years.  This might be the only company I've known but I do have friends that work at other company and this I know.  Not all companies give employees bonuses, stock options, ESOP, upward mobility, matching retirement funds, cash accounts, competitive salary, challenging work environment, on-site health care, on-site workout place, subsidized cafeteria, matching gift giving, involvement in charitable work and community, and many other good things.

My salary (and the salaries of my staff) are paid - and therefore the expense incurred- by EEL.  The oversight is that PwC should have recognized that I could have acted as agent for EEL and run off the portfolio thereby realizing positive cash to satisfy creditors of EEL.  It is too bad that we have administrators in London trying to handle a process of which they know absolutely nothing about.  Potential recovery for creditors -ignored.

./martin-t/deleted_items/207.:102:For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million through the exercise of Enron options, according to disclosure reports compiled by Thomson Financial. Last year, Mr. Lay was paid $8.3 million in salary and bonus and more than $10 million in stock awards and other compensation.
./martin-t/deleted_items/207.:107:Mr. Lay, who took charge of the then-Houston Natural Gas Co. in 1984 when it was a regional pipeline company, wasn't the only member of his family to benefit from Enron's heady rise to a global energy giant. SEC filings show that in recent years a sister of Mr. Lay, Sharon Lay, and a son, Mark Lay, received millions of dollars in salary, commissions and bonuses related to Ms. Lay's travel agency and a paper-products company connected to the younger Mr. Lay.
./martin-t/deleted_items/207.:112:Mark Lay also got a three-year employment contract from Enron as a vice president of Enron Capital & Trade. He got a signing bonus of $100,000, a minimum monthly salary of $12,500, a minimum annual bonus of $100,000 for 1997-1999 and an option to purchase 20,000 Enron shares. Mark Lay is no longer with Enron and is now attending a seminary, said Mr. Palmer.
./martin-t/deleted_items/207.:134:As previously reported, Mr. Lay sold $25.7 million of his Enron shares this year, as the stock fell from about $78 to under $44, and his remaining stake is valued at about $28 million. For 2000, he earned a salary of $1.3 million, a bonus of $7 million, plus $7.5 million in Enron restricted stock and other benefits, including use of a personal plane, according to Enron's proxy statement.
./martin-t/deleted_items/207.:175:All told, from 1989 through this year, Mr. Lay collected about $13 million in salary (his exact salary for this year is not known) and $26.8 million in cash bonuses. But those sums were dwarfed by the $266.7 million in profits that he received in selling stock.
./martin-t/deleted_items/207.:376:For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million through the exercise of Enron options, according to disclosure reports compiled by Thomson Financial.

./martin-t/deleted_items/32.:163:According to an SEC proxy statement filed on March 27, 2001, Lay's contract calls for him to receive a "lump sum payment for each full calendar year of the remaining term of the agreement equal to base salary, performance bonus, and long-term grant value received in calendar year 2000, offset against amounts payable under the severance plan maintained by Enron."
./martin-t/deleted_items/32.:164:Lay's employment agreement, which commenced in December 1996 and runs through Dec. 31, 2003, provides for a minimum salary of $1.3 million a year.
./martin-t/deleted_items/32.:165:According to the proxy statement, Lay in 2000 was paid a $1.3 million salary and a bonus of $7 million. Taking both figures into account and doubling them translates into $16.6 million, not counting the long-term grant value.
./martin-t/deleted_items/32.:738:Gramm's wife Wendy is on Enron's board and also served on its audit committee, which is supposed to keep a close watch on the company's financial practices. By their own accounting, the Gramms lost nearly $700,000 in stock options when the company went under. Wendy Gramm collected between $915,000 and $1.85 million from Enron in salary, attendance fees, stock options and dividends between 1993 and 2001, according to Public Citizen, a Washington watchdog group.
./martin-t/deleted_items/37.:252:Businesses are far more likely, however, to emphasize benefits as an inducement to sign on and stay with a company. Enron's employee handbook, for instance, lays out a rich buffet of benefits in addition to the 401(k) plan: a stock options plan that awarded up to 25 percent of salary in Enron stock options; subsidized membership at The Body Shop fitness center, complete with tai chi and Pilates classes; and an on-site doctor's office.

./williams-j/sent_items/128.:47:The best way to get Jason's salary transferred to the correct cost center (since it is only one pay period back), is to have him go into his SAP timesheet and have him code his time to the new cost center.  This way the system (SAP) will correct all his payroll costs automatically.
./williams-w3/bill_williams_iii/379.:21:I do not know the salary range for this position - but would expect it to be near entry level.  This may be a bit of a nip to John (Adams) - but as both Bill and I have been talking to him about for a year or so now - Enron is a great place to work, training is top shelf - we have good people, and need more good people to keep our edge.  Who knows what his career could go to in a few years. John has extensive background in pulp and paper, and could end up in that trading floor someday.

./zufferli-j/sent_items/216.:17:I talked to Milly yesterday, he was ok with the concept of covering the 1 month salary.  I talked to Trish and the easiest/non-tax affected way to handle it is to submit expense forms.  The problem is if you sell the car at a loss, then the loss compensation is tax deductible, if you import the car, then the transport costs/imports duties can be submitted as an expense and is not exposed to taxes. I talked to Trish about exactly what you have proposed and she wasn't sure from an equity standpoint between what was given to other employees that she could do that. However, don't worry about it I'll do my best so that you are kept whole in one way or another.  The easiest position for me to push is if you actually want to keep your car, then you can expense the duty.
