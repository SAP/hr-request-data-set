Effective January 1, 2002, the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) runs concurrently with Enron's Sick Leave policy.  An employee who is still disabled after using the 1,040 hours of sick leave pay ends may qualify for long term disability insurance.  Sick days cannot be carried over from one calendar year to the next and employees are not paid for sick days either at the end of the calendar year or upon termination.
./cash-m/deleted_items/217.:57:To be eligible for sick leave pay, employees unable to report to work must telephone their supervisor directly, each day of their absence, as far in advance as possible.  If their supervisor is not available, the employee's human resources representative should be contacted.  If an employee is unable to make the call personally, a family member or a friend should contact the supervisor.  The supervisor or human resources representative must be contacted each day of absence.  An employee who fails to contact his/her immediate supervisor or human resources representative may forfeit the sick leave pay and may be considered as having voluntarily resigned.  This policy must be followed unless an exception has been made for a particular absence, and a written memo to this effect has been sent to the employees' human resources representative.

Do you have any suggestions on what should be included in the tier information for HR regarding FMLA and or sick leave.  At the very least I think we should make it clear that HR is responsible for sending the FMLA notice letter out to employees when they are out sick and HR believes that the illness may fall under FMLA.  What are your thoughts?

./steffes-j/sent_items/2136.:90:At the urging of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association (CMTA) and other employer organizations, Governor Gray Davis vetoed SB 1197 by Senator Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles). The bill would have prohibited an employer to count any sick leave taken by an employee to tend to a sick child, parent or spouse in any absence control program
./steffes-j/sent_items/2136.:92:Current law permits an employee to use half of their annual accrued sick leave in a calendar year to attend to the illness of a child, parent, or spouse who would not otherwise qualify under the family medical leave act that only applies to serious health conditions.  The provision covers brief illnesses such as colds, high temperature, sore throats etc., that are more likely to be associated with children and is less likely to involve physician or hospital care.  However, employers opposed the bill because many employees take advantage of the easy threshold and use it to avoid workplace sanctions.
./steffes-j/sent_items/2136.:94:When employees don't show up or show up late for work, it negatively impacts production.  In order to mitigate this problem, employers have implemented absentee control programs that may include counseling, suspension and termination.  After the above provision became law, employers began to see a steady rise in the use and abuse of sick leave under this provision, so employers decided to include sick leave in their employee absence control programs in order to eliminate the abuse.  SB 1197 would have eliminated that option and could have forced employers to take a more drastic action to resolve the problem.
./steffes-j/sent_items/2136.:96:In addition to insuring that production schedules are met, the main reason for an employer's absence policy is to provide a fair way to identify and deal with those employees who have trouble coming to work as scheduled and/or on time.  Making a decision to sanction an employee under an absence control policy is not taken lightly by employers and must be based on sound reasoning.  For example, if an employee's attendance records were examined and patterns of use involving sick leave were to show unusually high usage on Fridays, Mondays and holiday weekends and the employee were to declare that the absences were for family member sick leave purposes, no disciplinary action could be taken. In other instances, it is used to cover for tardiness that would otherwise be sanctioned under the employer absence control program by calling in just before the shift begins in order to start the shift late.
./steffes-j/sent_items/2136.:98:SB 1197 would have provided for new lawsuits for violation of the statute where an employer has an absence control policy.  Consider that employers are not required to provide sick leave and the bill would only apply to those employers who voluntarily provide sick leave for their employees.  CMTA discussed with legislators the counter-productive nature of restricting an employer's ability to manage a voluntarily provided benefit. When laws become overly restrictive or very difficult to comply with and the employer is facing sanctions for violations, it provides a strong incentive for the employer to simply eliminate their sick leave program.
