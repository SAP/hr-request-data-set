Plus, although it is important for everyone in the team to regularly attend conferences, the favourited colleage gets to attend these conferences at least twice as often as other colleagues in our team. \nThere are many other examples that strengthed my suspicion and I do not want to go into details now. \nI am not sure how to address this properly. I have not confronted my manager or my colleague about this. But I definitely do not want to leave this unadressed.

Unfortunately, my manager has changed end of last year, and he did not apply the decision from previous manager, and I get the minimal increase of 1,2% which is unfair.\nI expect to fill the gape and to get the 7% increase as discussed previously. \nThanks \n\nMarcelo Vizcaino",
